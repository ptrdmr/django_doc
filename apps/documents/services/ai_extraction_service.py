CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:

1. **Be Exhaustive**: Extract EVERY piece of medical information, no matter how minor
2. **Preserve Exactness**: Copy information exactly as written, including units and abbreviations
3. **High Confidence**: Use confidence scores 0.8-1.0 for clearly stated information
4. **Complete Medications**: Never miss medication information - this is highest priority
5. **Multiple Instances**: Include ALL instances (e.g., multiple blood pressure readings)
6. **Dates and Times**: Always extract when information was recorded/occurred
7. **Context Preservation**: Maintain relationships between related information
8. **No Assumptions**: Only extract what is explicitly stated in the document

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
- Your response must ONLY be a valid JSON object
- No markdown code blocks, no explanations, no comments
- Start with { and end with }
- Include only sections with data found
- Use arrays for multiple instances of the same type
- Assign confidence scores based on clarity and certainty"""
