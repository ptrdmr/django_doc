However, he has had persistent\ngross hematuria into his catheter bag with clots since then. We discussed management options in the\noffice including cystoscopy. He reports he will need to be asleep for this. We discussed\nperforming a cystoscopy with clot evacuation, fulguration of bleeding, possible TURBT, and possible TURP\nThe risks and benefits were discussed including, but not limited to, bleeding, pain,\ninfection, damage to surrounding structures, possible need for additional procedures,\nrecurrence of the bleeding and other anesthetic risks. He expressed understanding and\nagreed to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:\nAfter written and verbal informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the\noperative suite and placed supine on the OR table. General anesthesia was induced, and he was then\npositioned in modified dorsal lithotomy position with all pressure points padded. The patient's\ngroin was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion and a formal timeout was performed to\nconfirm proper patient, procedure, and administration of preoperative antibiotics. I began by inserting a lubricated rigid cystoscope through the patient's urethra into the bladder. Immediately upon entering the membranous urethra a significant amount of friable, inflamed tissue was\nnoted. Once within the bladder a large amount of clot was identified. Next, using a Toomey syringe, the clot was systematically irrigated out of the\nbladder. A very large amount of clot was irrigated out. After this had been completed, I turned my attention to cystoscopy. However, there was still some bleeding\noccurring which made visualization difficult. Therefore, the decision was made to remove the\ncystoscope and insert a resectoscope with continuous flow. The cystoscope was removed, and with the aid of the visual obturator a resectoscope sheath was\n\n--- Page 41 ---\nadvanced through the patient's urethra into the bladder. With continuous irrigation I was able to\nidentify significant bleeding from the anterior bladder neck and right bladder neck. The remainder of the\nbladder was surveyed and no tumors or other abnormalities were seen aside from bladder trabeculation. Next, the button cautery was affixed to the resectoscope, and I began with\nsystematic fulguration of bleeding along the bladder neck. Essentially the entire bladder neck\nwas fulgurated as it was noted to be friable and bleeding, particularly along the anterior and right side. The ureters were noted to be well clear of the fulguration sites. After this had been completed, the bladder was then again meticulously surveyed with both the 30- and\n70-degree lenses once visualization had improved. No tumors or other abnormalities were seen. There was mild catheter-associated cystitis along the posterior wall, but no other abnormalities. After this had been completed, I carefully observed the area of fulguration with irrigation on and off and\nwith the bladder filled and emptied, and excellent hemostasis was ensured. After this had been\ncompleted, the bladder was left partially inflated and the resectoscope was removed.

The balloon was inflated with 25 m L of sterile water and the catheter was hooked to gravity\ndrainage. The third port was capped and excellent drainage of clear efflux was observed. At this point the procedure was complete. The patient was taken out of dorsal lithotomy position, awoken\nfrom general anesthesia and brought to recovery room in stable condition having tolerated the\nprocedure well with no complications.
