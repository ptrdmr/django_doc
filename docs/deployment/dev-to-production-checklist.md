# 🚀 Development to Production Transition Checklist

## 📊 **Implementation Status Guide**

**This checklist covers both current implementation and planned features:**
- ✅ **Currently Working** - Implemented and tested in development
- 🚧 **Partially Implemented** - Code exists but needs completion
- 📋 **Planned - Task 23** - Will be implemented during final deployment preparation
- ⚠️ **Known Gap** - Missing component that needs attention

## Overview

This checklist documents all the critical changes needed when transitioning from development (`docker-compose.yml`) to production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) deployment.

## 📁 Static Files Handling

### Development Configuration ✅ **Currently Working**
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
volumes:
  - .:/app                    # ✅ Working: Mounts entire project directory
  - media_volume:/app/media
  - logs_volume:/app/logs

command: >
  sh -c "python manage.py migrate &&
         python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"  # ✅ Working: No collectstatic needed
```

**Why it works in development:**
- Django development server serves static files automatically when `DEBUG=True` ✅ **Working**
- No nginx involved, Django handles everything ✅ **Working**
- Project mount makes development easier (live code reloading) ✅ **Working**

### Production Configuration 🚧 **Partially Implemented**
```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml
volumes:
  - static_volume:/app/staticfiles  # ✅ Volume defined and mapped
  - media_volume:/app/media
  - logs_volume:/app/logs
  # ✅ NO project directory mount (security best practice)

command: >
  sh -c "python manage.py migrate --noinput &&
         python manage.py collectstatic --noinput &&  # ✅ Command implemented
         gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 ..."            # ✅ Gunicorn configured
```

**Why production is different:**
- Gunicorn doesn't serve static files ✅ **Correctly configured**
- Nginx reverse proxy serves static files from the volume 📋 **Planned - Task 23**
- No live code mounting for security and performance ✅ **Implemented**

### 🔧 Static Files Troubleshooting

**Current Implementation Status:**

1. **Nginx Configuration** 📋 **Planned - Task 23**
   - **Status:** `docker/nginx/nginx.conf` and `docker/nginx/default.conf` don't exist yet
   - **Planned:** Create nginx configuration files during Task 23 (Final System Integration)
   - **Current Workaround:** Production compose references these as placeholders

2. **Static Collection Process** ✅ **Working in Container**
   - **Status:** Dockerfile and compose commands correctly run collectstatic
   - **Note:** Works properly when containers are built and run

**Common Issues When Transitioning:**

1. **Missing Nginx Files (Expected Currently)** 📋 **Planned - Task 23**
   - **Cause:** Nginx configs are planned for final deployment preparation
   - **Timeline:** Will be implemented during Task 23
   - **Workaround:** Development mode works perfectly for current phase

2. **Static Files Collection** ✅ **Working**
   - **Status:** collectstatic runs correctly in production container startup
   - **Verified:** Static volume mapping works as designed

3. **Static Files Serving** 📋 **Planned - Task 23**
   - **Current:** Not yet implemented (nginx configs missing)
   - **Planned:** Full nginx static file serving in Task 23

## 🔐 Environment Variables & Settings

### Development Settings ✅ **Currently Working**
```python
# meddocparser/settings/development.py
DEBUG = True                                    # ✅ Working
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '0.0.0.0']  # ✅ Working
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False                     # ✅ Working
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False                   # ✅ Working
```

### Production Settings ✅ **Currently Working**
```python
# meddocparser/settings/production.py
DEBUG = False  # ✅ Correctly configured
ALLOWED_HOSTS = config('ALLOWED_HOSTS', default='').split(',')  # ✅ Working
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True      # ✅ Ready for SSL
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True    # ✅ Ready for SSL
```

### Environment Variables Changes ✅ **Template Ready**
```bash
# Development (.env) - ✅ Template exists in env.example
DEBUG=1
DB_HOST=localhost

# Production (.env.prod) - 📋 Planned - Task 23
DEBUG=0
DB_HOST=db
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
```

## 🐳 Docker Configuration Changes

### Container Resource Limits
```yaml
# Development: No limits (for debugging) - ✅ Currently Working
services:
  web:
    # No deploy section - allows unlimited resources for development

# Production: Resource limits - ✅ Already Configured
services:
  web:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 1G          # ✅ Configured
          cpus: '0.5'         # ✅ Configured
      replicas: 2             # ✅ Configured
```

### Exposed vs Published Ports
```yaml
# Development: Published ports for direct access - ✅ Currently Working
ports:
  - "8000:8000"  # ✅ Working: Direct access to Django

# Production: Exposed ports only - ✅ Configured
expose:
  - "8000"  # ✅ Ready: Only accessible within Docker network
```

## 🌐 Web Server Changes

### Development ✅ **Currently Working**
- **Django development server** (`runserver`) ✅ **Working**
- Single-threaded, perfect for development ✅ **Working**
- Serves static files automatically ✅ **Working**
- Hot reloading for development ✅ **Working**

### Production ✅ **Configured, Nginx Pending**
- **Gunicorn WSGI server** with multiple workers ✅ **Configured**
- Production-grade HTTP server ✅ **Ready**
- Does NOT serve static files ✅ **Correctly configured**
- No hot reloading (security feature) ✅ **Correct**

### Nginx Reverse Proxy 📋 **Planned - Task 23**
```nginx
# docker/nginx/default.conf - Will be created in Task 23
location /static/ {
    alias /var/www/staticfiles/;  # Maps to static_volume
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}

location / {
    proxy_pass http://web:8000;  # Forwards to Gunicorn
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Logging

### Development ✅ **Currently Working**
```yaml
# Simple console logging - working perfectly
command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Production ✅ **Fully Configured**
```yaml
# Comprehensive logging - ready to go
command: >
  gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 
           --workers 4 
           --timeout 120 
           --access-logfile /app/logs/gunicorn_access.log 
           --error-logfile /app/logs/gunicorn_error.log 
           meddocparser.wsgi:application
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Development Security (Relaxed) ✅ **Currently Working**
- CORS allows all origins ✅ **Appropriate for dev**
- No SSL redirect ✅ **Correct for local dev**
- Simplified authentication for testing ✅ **Working**

### Production Security ✅ **Configured, SSL Pending**
- Specific CORS origins only ✅ **Ready**
- Force HTTPS redirects ✅ **Ready when SSL implemented**
- Enhanced session security ✅ **Configured**
- Content Security Policy enforcement ✅ **Ready**
