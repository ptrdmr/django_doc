# ðŸš€ Deployment Documentation

## Overview

Production deployment guides and configurations for the Medical Document Parser.

## Current Deployment Setup

### Docker Configuration âœ… Completed
- **Development**: docker-compose.yml with all services
- **Production**: docker-compose.prod.yml with nginx, SSL, and resource limits
- **Services**: Django web app, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery worker/beat, Flower monitoring

### Container Features
- Multi-stage Docker builds for security and efficiency
- Health checks for all services
- Non-root user execution
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Production Deployment Options

### Option 1: Single Server Docker Deployment
- Docker Compose production setup
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL
- PostgreSQL and Redis in containers
- Suitable for small to medium deployments

### Option 2: Kubernetes Deployment
- Scalable container orchestration
- Separate pods for web, workers, database
- Horizontal auto-scaling
- Enterprise-grade monitoring and logging

### Option 3: Cloud Platform Deployment
- AWS/Azure/GCP managed services
- Managed databases (RDS, Cloud SQL)
- Container services (ECS, AKS, GKE)
- CDN and load balancing

## Security Considerations

### HIPAA Compliance in Production
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- Network segmentation and firewalls
- Access logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates and patches
- Backup encryption and retention policies

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- Valid SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or commercial)
- Strong cipher suites and protocols
- HSTS and security headers
- Certificate monitoring and renewal

## Monitoring & Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- User activity monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
- Database performance monitoring
- Redis cache hit rates
- Celery task queue monitoring

## Backup & Recovery

### Database Backups
- Automated PostgreSQL backups
- Encrypted backup storage
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Regular backup restoration testing

### Media & Document Backups
- Medical document file backups
- Secure offsite storage
- HIPAA-compliant retention policies
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Performance Optimization

### Web Application
- Gunicorn worker optimization
- Static file serving via nginx
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching strategies

### Database Optimization
- PostgreSQL configuration tuning
- Index optimization for JSONB queries
- Query performance monitoring
- Connection pooling and limits

### Celery Task Processing
- Worker scaling strategies
- Queue monitoring and alerting
- Task retry and error handling
- Resource allocation optimization
