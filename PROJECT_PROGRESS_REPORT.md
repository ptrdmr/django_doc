# Medical Document Parser - Project Progress Report

## Executive Summary

**Project Status: 44% Complete (8 of 18 major tasks)**
- **Core Infrastructure**: âœ… Complete (Django + Docker + Auth)
- **Patient & Provider Management**: âœ… Complete  
- **Document Processing**: âœ… Complete (AI integration with Claude/GPT)
- **FHIR Data Management**: âœ… Complete (merge algorithms & validation)
- **Security Foundation**: âœ… Complete (HIPAA baseline)

## What We've Accomplished

### âœ… Production-Ready Modules (44% of project)
1. **Django Foundation** - Full project structure with Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis/Celery
2. **Authentication System** - Login/logout with dashboard navigation
3. **Patient Management** - Complete CRUD with FHIR history tracking
4. **Provider Management** - Directory, profiles, patient linking
5. **Document Processing** - AI-powered extraction (Claude/GPT) with chunking & cost monitoring
6. **FHIR Integration** - Sophisticated merge algorithms with conflict resolution
7. **Security Baseline** - Django security settings for HIPAA compliance
8. **Core Infrastructure** - All foundational pieces operational

### ðŸ”„ What's Next (56% remaining)
- **Document Review Interface** - User review of extracted data before merge
- **Reports Module** - Patient summaries, provider activity, system metrics  
- **Enhanced Security** - Audit logging, PHI encryption, role-based access
- **User Account Management** - Profile/preferences (low priority)
- **Final Integration** - Cross-module testing and deployment prep

We're extremely pleased with the technical foundation we've established. The sophisticated FHIR merge algorithms and AI document processing represent the most complex parts of the system and are production-ready. The heavy engineering lift is complete - what remains is primarily interface development and compliance features.

## This Week's Task: HIPAA Audit Logging System

**Priority: HIGH** | **Est. Effort: 3-4 days**

We're tackling the HIPAA audit logging system next because it's a critical compliance requirement that affects all user interactions with patient data. This foundational security component must be in place before we can implement the remaining user-facing features like the document review interface and reports module. The audit system will automatically log all PHI access, modifications, and user activities - ensuring we meet HIPAA's comprehensive tracking requirements.

## Codebase Distribution by Module

**Current Codebase: 54,604 lines of Python code**

| Module | Status | % of Codebase | Lines | Description |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------|-------------|
| **FHIR Processing** | âœ… Done | **74.5%** | 40,704 | Complex merge algorithms, validation, conflict resolution |
| **Document Processing** | âœ… Done | **15.4%** | 8,392 | AI integration, PDF parsing, Celery tasks |
| **Core Infrastructure** | âœ… Done | **5.2%** | 2,836 | Models, middleware, utils, migrations |
| **Patient Management** | âœ… Done | **2.2%** | 1,197 | CRUD operations, search, history |
| **Provider Management** | âœ… Done | **2.2%** | 1,203 | Directory, profiles, linking |
| **Authentication** | âœ… Done | **0.4%** | 242 | Login/logout, user views |
| **Reports Module** | ðŸ”„ Pending | **0.1%** | 29 | Stub files only |

### Estimated Final Distribution
| Component | Current % | Est. Final % | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| FHIR Processing | 74.5% | ~65% | Core algorithms complete |
| Document Processing | 15.4% | ~18% | Add review interface |
| Reports & Analytics | 0.1% | ~8% | Major expansion needed |
| Core/Security | 5.2% | ~7% | Add audit/encryption |
| Patient/Provider UI | 4.4% | ~2% | Mostly complete |
