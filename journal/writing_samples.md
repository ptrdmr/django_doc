Preface:
You know, I'm not exactly a glass half full kinda guy... or half empty for that matter. In fact I sometimes forget to consider the glass. I'm typically thinking about what's in it. But before I describe anything of my process, I must acknowledge my doubt. Given the manor in which I'm conducting this development, I must assume some degree of failure. Either due to my own ignorance, or because of pure rotten luck. I have to assume that this goes poorly.

It would be irresponsible to think that through very little effort of my own, that I should be bestowed a miracle tool such that I am using, and not pay a penance.

There will be problems. There will be mistakes. I will not see everything. Regret in some form is guaranteed.

Even still I continue on, hoping what little awareness I am blessed with will help me take full advantage of these opportunities, blind and foolish though I am.

1. Build a web app for a start up
Over a year ago now
...I began communicating with my cousin about her idea for a new business. Fueled by a need to do better by the people she helped on a daily basis, she had a fairly clear picture of what she needed. It didn't take long before my mind did what it does. I saw the holes in the tools she was using, and I knew I might do better for her.

There are of course different levels to our vision for the project. But it needed a cornerstone and a bedrock to build on. My first inclination, my first real question to her was, "how will you process all the documents"? It was a huge blocker. You want to help people control their medical history, and prepare for end of life? You need to consolidate their data, and doing that by hand is archaic and slow. We needed to process documents. So that became our goal. The vision for the company also needed something that could be useful to the short term clients directly, and in the future would function as a foundational feature for our bigger ideas. We had our MVP

There have been 3 attempts at this build. Each was a complete reimagining of the last. Trimming fat and features that didn't get us to that MVP. Restructuring the DB schema to be more elastic to change, more extensible to future features, and more communicable to future partners.

The hardest part was the trimming features. I found out what many people find when they start to build software. Scope creep is real. You want to waterfall everything into existence. Something about holding back a feature seems to manifest a fear of not being enough. This is of course incorrect. It's often the simple starts that carry you the farthest.

We needed to go:

Document -> Discrete Records -> Simple Patient History

So we stepped off.

March 20, 2024 - Dream

As best as I can recollect, it started with me being on “vacation” on an island. I made the trip through customs and I think I was on a boat? But mostly I quickly appeared on an island, the details are hazy. But quickly it transitioned into a house that resembled Grandmas in AZ. I think I woke up from the dream of the island, afraid that I’d left my medication at home. But I hadn’t left yet. Then it get’s weird. My room was my moms room from when we lived there. But it was cluttered, and in the far right corner there was an odd 4 poster bed with one of the posts collapsed and I was verbally combating some sort of entity in the room. This demon was clearly the source of my nightmare, and did end up waking me from my sleep for a time(into reality, not another dream level). But before it did that I think I remember trying to move through the cluttered room towards what I can only assume was my bed, only to be pushed back or harassed by the entity. I do not remember what it said, or if it said anything, but It was an attack on my soul. I awoke and entered into prayer, like an infant reaching for my mother. I prayed to a god I am not confident in, to push the entity out. A holy rebuke, and a hope that I would be left in peace. 


I settled into another dream where I remember Shaun being with me. I think we lived in a house with some other people, a lady and a child. I was friends with the child I believe and was concerned with her protection. At some point I drove a large truck around (an 18 wheeler i think), and was harassed on a small road while attempting to drive it. I think we all made it back home, but the truck was damaged and it was raining. Shaun went outside with the lady and fixed the truck. I don’t remember much beyond that, though I’m confident I’m skipping much.


There is a third dream, where it happened in relation to the others I can’t say. But it involved me and some familiar people sitting at a dinner table with a T-Rex. A little amusing I know, but it sat for most of the meal in general peace with us, until after a while it became enraged and began to try and attack us. This dream may actually have happened before the others, but I remembered it last, so it’s written last.

-What keeps me up?
Helping someone in a way that is completely separated from the innate selfishness of wanting to help.



-Funny Women
They’re just like funny men. Avoidant, distant and unavailable.

I’m not sure how to say things quickly. When I do, I misrepresent, and I make mistakes. 

So I’ll try to take my time. 

I do not feel that life has a push to it anymore. Everyday it takes more and more effort to maintain my connections to people and things. And it takes even more effort to stay connected to myself.

I am blessed. But I do not feel it.
To truly calm myself, and quiet my brain, I must stop and focus. I have so much given to me for my efforts, when some do not enjoy the same affordance. It may be important to note that I do tend to have an innate understanding of things, and that understanding gives me a foresight when it comes to attempting to do creative or ambitious things. 

So many people I know are just… stuck. Stuck in who they are or who they were. And perhaps it isn’t that I’m able to transcend who I was, but rather, that I never fully enveloped myself in it. Maybe I knew myself so little that I had just simply underutilized my own potential. Maybe I’ve always been this way. This, strong. This, intelligent. This, fortunate. Maybe I just never saw it.

Maybe this is what it means to be a human. 

And still, I know I can become more.

But, to the question of “why?”, I have no answer. I SAY I want to support my family. But I’ve yet to give myself enough love so as to allow someone real to love me. I am a coward in this way. Women, as lovers,  require you to be courageous. I will stand in fire, but never have I been able to weather the storm of a woman.

New Job, then? New Love.

It's scary and strange that I'm a real person. Sometimes I sit and listen to people talk, and I wonder if they see me. Sitting there. 1,000 miles away from them. Observing myself listening to them. There are moments where a slight drop in the stomach overtakes me. Where fear, like a predator has caught me, jolts my mind. I see the person there, talking to me, expecting a human…But getting me instead. Some guy piloting a little meat ship, watching life through a screen

I feel disconnected from what I'm supposed to be. It's hard to care sometimes, when i'm always living in a hole on the other side of the universe.

I do want to be immersed. I do want to play and participate. But I've always been alone. And I feel so far from fixing it.

I woke to the late morning stillness of my room. My head is swimming with thoughts of 2024. Tumultuous right to the end. 

I saw the beginning of new worlds last year. An expanding galaxy of my life. As friends in my orbit drift just a bit farther, to do new things and explore their own area of the cosmos, I feel I'm also building a new world for myself.

So many things were broken down last year, and so many new things are being built from those pieces. Like those Japanese pots, the ones they repair with gold?(kintsugi) They're always just a little bigger, and far more brilliant to look at. 

I know I've got to move past a few things. As I get older it's harder to give energy to so many different areas and people. This year is going to be about conservation. Consolidation. I will speak less, plan more and never stop working towards my new way of living.

New career

Cheers to a new year. Stay buttoned.

Today I’d just like to write down some thoughts I’ve had lately.

When asked “what has life taught you?”:
Let your loves stay as your loves.
Your professional acumen and opportunities will come with time. You can’t force the development of relationships or ideas.
Ideas that come to you,that are temporally related, may be related in other ways. Your mind is a lens and it focuses on a point that is sometimes obfuscated. Remember to compare and contrast.
What could be, is rarely important. What should be, is a bit important. What is, remains most important.
Between mastery ○ & release |  lies joy -
New career
No Alcohol
Learn more
Strengthen my body

Stay Buttoned.

I just don’t feel like I’m worth the trouble today. It’s an old thought. But a powerful one.

It has power over me, though I’m a fool for even giving it energy. 

I’m a fool for not seeing my value, for not allowing myself to be a part of the world around me.

The world is moving so quickly. I need something to hold on to. Something soon. Or else the work I’m doing, the life I’ve lived might just be for nothing. 

I look around me, and I both can’t hold on, and can’t let go, simultaneously.
Can’t hold on to new people and things.
Can’t let go of the insecurities that have plagued me for my entire life.

I need help. 

What does help look like?
Someone to hold.
Someone who depends on me.
Someone who I can depend on.

There’s a push these days to insulate your problems from your friends. That your mental health should be handled by professionals. That bringing your problems into a relationship or friendship is irresponsible. There’s a silent implication that you should be sterile, unburdened by fault, in order to move with someone. But maybe that’s bullshit. Maybe that’s evil. Maybe humans need each other to live. Like water. We can’t survive without each other.

I like a girl. But everything in me and around me tells me that it’s fake. Fanciful and romantic. I think if I were to act on her directly, it would do great harm. I’m too old, she’s too young. We work together. I’m fooling myself. 

I also can’t decide if this ^^^ is just my brain defeating me before I even start.

Trinity De La Cruz. How many people have vied for your attention? How many more will fail?

Will I even try?

Think I should pray tonight.

I am deserving.

I don’t mean it in a vain way. We all deserve things. I deserve someone who’s going to give me time and focus, who’s going to support me and who will bring positive change to my life. And I also deserve someone who is able to receive that FROM me. 

The worst situations I’ve ever been in, have been the ones where one party is luke warm or hesitant and doesn’t know what to do because they were just hoping to “chill”, and the other party is all in on the relationship.

It’s not the “neverhappens” that get you, those can exist in idealist perfection for infinity, through no effort. It’s the near misses that get you, that hurt you.

I’m a mean person.

I feel like I’m mean. 

I feel like others suffer for knowing me.

I feel like deep down I’m a bad person who secretly wishes to die.

These are foolish things.

My existence is within the scope and parameters of human existence.

I value those people who are kind. But there is also a portion of me that doesn’t respect those people. Who sees them as weak.I see weakness in a lot of people.I wonder if my own weakness makes me acutely aware and judgmental of others weaknesses. 

I’d cut your throat if it meant you understood you did something wrong. (metaphorical)

But THAT is wrong, of course. If there are no more second chances (ad nauseum), we’d just spend all of our time killing each other. There’d be none of you left. None of ME left.

As always I need to work on being more kind.



Dream:
A mother cat under my bed, 3 lovely strong kittens and one that was… mutated or deformed somehow? I don’t’ think it lived, but i’m not certain
I think there were other creatures in my room. I also think i had a different room with small creatures in cages.

I remember a profound sense of inconvenience? There were people there who were unhappy about the creatures, but happy about the cats.

Fear

I’ve always felt uncertain. Always felt unprepared. 

It feels like being squished into too little space. 

The inverse of which might be sitting along among trees with a hot cup of coffee. 

Instead, when confronted with something you know not what, the darkness twirls and crunches in, then expands to fill every crevice of your head(mind?). 

If you hadn’t noticed I’m slow walking this feeling so as not to scare it away.

The tension of the unknown has always been there with me. It’s hand on my shoulder and it’s lips to my ear. 

Soccer, when I was a kid. Public school, once mom couldn’t home school us anymore. Girls… pretty much always. Work, from the day I said “yes” to Concourse. Girls, again… lol


But the only thing I never felt afraid of? Music. Guitar. Playing with my band. 

Frustrated? For sure. Annoyed? Absolutely. Stressed? You betcha. But never, ever afraid of it.


I’ve tried to take myself out of the anxiety of the unknown. I’ve tried to take my quiet demeanor and transform it from quiet nervousness, to quiet confidence. 

I’ve got lots of work still to do. But I am proud of myself and how far I’ve come. 

Being able to look something up and down and tell if it’s for me or not has gotten a lot easier.

One day this open mind might just learn how to filter all the cascading thoughts, and turn them into a focused point of personal power. (alliteration!) But until then, I will keep trying.

I’m tired.

I’m in a transitional state.

I’m worried.

I’m concerned.

I’m afraid.                    But I’m not stopping.

I asked (in prayer), to be allowed to build something. I put that out into the world. I spoke it. I yearned fer it. And now? It’s been given to me.

It’s mine to fail. It’s mine to lose. And I will not lose it for trying. If I have to hunker down and sit at this computer for another 3 years. I will see this through to the end. 

I’m building something. For better or worse. I’m building something.

There’s a lot worse places to be right now. And flying under the radar while building something that could help me take care of my family, well that’s worth the damn trouble.


Wish me luck.

Getting back into a rhythm.

It’s been a few weeks since I hit the gym and honestly it’s just an indicator of a more extensive problem. 

I’ve been letting lots of stuff fall to the side while I worry about the projects I’m doing.

The equation of personal production:
A Project / Time * (1 + Motivation) = what you produce
