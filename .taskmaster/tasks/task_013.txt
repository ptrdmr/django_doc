# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Document Review Interface
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the frontend user interface for reviewing extracted document data, allowing users to view, edit, and approve the extracted information before it gets merged into patient records.
# Details:
Implement the document review interface with the following components:

1. Create a new Django template for the document review page:
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="document-review-container">
  <div class="document-preview">
    <!-- Document preview panel -->
  </div>
  <div class="extraction-review">
    <!-- Extracted data review forms -->
  </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

2. Implement the document preview panel:
   - Display the original document using PDF.js or a similar viewer
   - Add highlighting capabilities to show where data was extracted from
   - Implement zoom and navigation controls

3. Create the extracted data review forms:
   - Build Django forms for each data category (patient info, medications, diagnoses, etc.)
   - Implement form validation for medical data types
   - Add UI elements to mark fields as verified, incorrect, or needs review

4. Implement htmx integration for interactive editing:
   - Add htmx attributes to form elements for real-time validation
   - Create Django view endpoints for partial updates
   - Implement optimistic UI updates with proper error handling
   ```html
   <input type="text" name="medication_name" 
          hx-post="{% url 'update_medication_field' %}"
          hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:500ms"
          hx-target="#medication-feedback">
   <div id="medication-feedback"></div>
   ```

5. Build the approval workflow UI:
   - Create approval buttons (Approve, Reject, Request Changes)
   - Implement confirmation dialogs for key actions
   - Add comment/notes field for reviewers
   - Build status indicators showing review progress

6. Implement the review context sidebar:
   - Display patient context information
   - Show document metadata (upload date, document type, etc.)
   - List previous documents for comparison

7. Create the controller view in views.py:
   ```python
   def document_review(request, document_id):
       document = get_object_or_404(Document, id=document_id)
       extracted_data = document.extracted_data.all()
       
       if request.method == 'POST':
           # Handle form submission and approval actions
           if 'approve' in request.POST:
               document.status = 'approved'
               document.save()
               # Trigger merge to patient record
               merge_to_patient_record.delay(document.id)
               messages.success(request, "Document approved and data merged.")
               return redirect('document_list')
       
       context = {
           'document': document,
           'extracted_data': extracted_data,
           'patient': document.patient,
       }
       return render(request, 'documents/review.html', context)
   ```

8. Add URL routing in urls.py:
   ```python
   path('documents/<int:document_id>/review/', views.document_review, name='document_review'),
   path('documents/update-field/', views.update_field, name='update_field'),
   ```

9. Implement CSS styles for the review interface:
   - Create responsive layout for side-by-side document and form view
   - Style form elements for clear data entry
   - Design approval workflow buttons and status indicators
   - Implement highlighting styles for extracted data fields

## STRATEGIC PIVOT - TEXT SNIPPET APPROACH

The document review interface is being updated to use a text snippet review approach instead of complex PDF highlighting for the MVP. This change will simplify implementation while improving user experience.

### Key Changes:

1. **Text Snippet Display**:
   - Add source_snippets field to ParsedData model to store text context (200-300 characters) around extracted values
   - Display these snippets alongside each extracted data field for context
   - Implement UI to show snippet/value pairs in the extraction review panel

2. **Field-Level Actions**:
   - Add per-field action buttons: [Approve] [Edit] [Flag for Review]
   - Implement confidence indicators for each extracted field (high/medium/low)
   - Add visual styling to indicate confidence levels (green/yellow/red)

3. **Missing Field Detection**:
   - Add functionality to identify potentially missing fields
   - Implement UI to show suggested fields that might be missing
   - Allow reviewers to add missing fields manually

4. **Simplified Document Viewer**:
   - Keep PDF viewer for reference but remove highlighting implementation
   - Focus on making the viewer performant and responsive
   - Maintain zoom and navigation controls for document review

5. **Backend Changes**:
   - Update AI extraction pipeline to capture text context around extracted values
   - Modify AI prompts to include snippet extraction requirements
   - Add confidence scoring for extracted fields

6. **Enhanced Inline Editing**:
   - Focus on robust inline editing capabilities with immediate feedback
   - Implement auto-save functionality for edited fields
   - Add field validation specific to medical data types

This pivot maintains the same user workflow but provides better UX and faster implementation for the MVP while removing the technical complexity of PDF highlighting.

## TASK REASSESSMENT - CURRENT STATUS UPDATE

Based on the critical findings and project reality assessment, the following changes are needed:

### Current Implementation Status
- The document review interface is already functional with a sophisticated working system
- The existing implementation includes PDF viewing, snippet-based review, field-level actions, and approval workflow
- The strategic pivot to text snippet approach has been successfully implemented
- Patient Information Review Form is complete with confidence indicators and snippet display

### Revised Task Direction
1. **Cancel redundant subtasks**: Subtasks that duplicate existing functionality should be marked as cancelled
2. **Focus on Patient Data Validation & Comparison**:
   - Implement comparison between extracted data and existing patient records
   - Create visual indicators for data discrepancies
   - Build UI for selecting which data source to trust (document vs. existing record)
   - Develop audit trail for patient record updates
   - Add smart suggestions based on confidence scores

### New Subtasks to Create
1. **Implement Patient Record Comparison View**
   - Display side-by-side comparison of extracted data vs. existing patient record
   - Highlight discrepancies with clear visual indicators
   - Allow toggling between sources

2. **Build Data Resolution Interface**
   - Create UI for selecting authoritative data source
   - Implement conflict resolution workflow
   - Add reasoning/notes field for documenting decisions

3. **Develop Audit Trail for Patient Updates**
   - Track all changes to patient records from document review
   - Record who made changes and their justification
   - Create viewable history of patient record modifications

4. **Implement Smart Data Suggestions**
   - Use confidence scores to suggest optimal data choices
   - Provide auto-resolution for high-confidence matches
   - Flag low-confidence items for manual review

This revised approach builds upon the existing working review interface rather than rebuilding redundant components, focusing efforts on enhancing patient data validation and comparison capabilities.
