# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement Optimistic Concurrency Merge System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the document processing pipeline from a pessimistic locking model to an optimistic concurrency model that merges data immediately and flags exceptions for review. This architectural shift removes the human bottleneck that prevents clinical staff from accessing parsed medical data in real-time, while maintaining data quality through intelligent automated flagging and surgical rollback capabilities.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive optimistic concurrency system with the following components:

1. **Data Model Changes**:
   - Add `auto_approved` (BooleanField) and `flag_reason` (TextField) to ParsedData model
   - Update REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES to the 5-state machine: 'pending', 'auto_approved', 'flagged', 'reviewed', 'rejected'
   - Add methods `determine_review_status()` and `check_quick_conflicts()`
   - Add indexes on `auto_approved` and `(review_status, created_at)`

2. **Patient Model Enhancements**:
   - Implement `update_fhir_resources(fhir_resources, document_id)` method for idempotent merges
   - Implement `rollback_document_merge(document_id)` for surgical removal of resources
   - Use Django's transaction management to ensure atomicity
   - Ensure meta.source tagging for document traceability

3. **Quality Check Logic**:
   - Implement flag conditions in `determine_review_status()`:
     - Extraction confidence < 0.80
     - Fallback AI model used
     - Zero resources extracted
     - Fewer than 3 resources AND confidence < 0.95
     - DOB/name conflicts with patient record
   - Optimize for < 100ms performance on quick checks

4. **Task Flow Modification**:
   - Update `process_document_async` in tasks.py to implement immediate merge
   - Call `determine_review_status()` and then merge regardless of flag status
   - Set appropriate status flags and handle errors gracefully

5. **Data Migration**:
   - Create migration to map existing records to new status system
   - Test thoroughly on staging data before deployment

6. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for quality check logic, FHIR operations
   - Integration tests for the entire workflow
   - Performance tests for merge operations (< 500ms target)
   - Retry safety tests for idempotency

7. **Staging Deployment & Monitoring**:
   - Deploy to staging and process test documents
   - Monitor flag rates (5-20% target) and tune thresholds
   - Validate merge performance and failure rates

8. **Flagged Items UI**:
   - Create dashboard widget showing flagged count
   - Build flagged items list view and detail/verification view
   - Implement actions: Mark as Correct, Correct Data, Rollback Merge

9. **Cleanup Old Review Workflow**:
   - Remove obsolete code and templates
   - Update documentation
   - Deploy to production

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Use Django 4.2+ for the latest ORM features and performance improvements
- Leverage Django's transaction.atomic() for FHIR operations
- Use Django-FHIR (fhirstore 2.x) for FHIR resource handling
- Implement Celery task idempotency using unique task IDs
- Use Django signals for audit trail creation
- Consider using Django REST Framework 3.14+ for the flagged items API
- Implement proper exception handling with contextual error messages
- Use Django's select_related() and prefetch_related() to optimize queries
- Consider adding Redis caching for frequently accessed patient data

**Libraries and Versions:**
- Django 4.2+
- Celery 5.3+
- Django REST Framework 3.14+
- fhirstore 2.x
- django-auditlog 2.2+ for audit trails
- django-filter 23.1+ for flagged items filtering
- pytest 7.3+ for testing

**Database Considerations:**
- Add appropriate indexes for performance
- Use Django's F() expressions to prevent race conditions
- Consider partial indexes for flagged items
- Use select_for_update() where appropriate for concurrent operations

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each flag condition in isolation
   - Test resource matching logic in update_fhir_resources()
   - Test rollback filtering logic
   - Test performance of quick checks (< 100ms)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end document processing with immediate merge
   - Test retry safety (run task twice, verify no duplicates)
   - Test flagged documents still merge successfully
   - Test rollback removes only target document's resources

3. **Test Data**:
   - Create fixtures for various document types:
     - High confidence document (should auto-approve)
     - Low confidence document (should flag)
     - Document with DOB conflict (should flag)
     - Document with zero resources (should flag)

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark merge operations (target: < 500ms)
   - Test with large FHIR bundles (100+ resources)
   - Test concurrent merges (10+ simultaneous)

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Verify existing document processing still works
   - Verify audit trail completeness
   - Verify no data loss during migration

6. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify clinicians can see data within 5 minutes
   - Verify data stewards can efficiently review flagged items
   - Verify compliance officers can access audit trail

7. **Monitoring Tests**:
   - Set up metrics collection for flag rates
   - Set up alerts for high flag rates or merge failures
   - Verify threshold tuning works as expected

## 6. Implement update_fhir_resources method in Patient model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a method to handle idempotent merging of FHIR resources into the patient record using composite key matching.
### Details:
Add update_fhir_resources(fhir_resources, document_id) method to the Patient model with the following implementation:

**Composite Key Matching Strategy:**
- Match existing resources using (meta.source, resourceType) tuple to identify duplicates
- This ensures idempotency - if the same document is processed twice, resources are updated rather than duplicated
- For each incoming resource:
  * Check if (meta.source, resourceType) already exists in patient's bundle
  * If exists: UPDATE the existing resource
  * If new: APPEND to bundle

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Django's transaction.atomic() for atomicity
- Tag all resources with meta.source = "document_{document_id}"
- Tag all resources with meta.lastUpdated = current timestamp
- Tag all resources with meta.versionId = UUID

**Audit Trail (HIPAA Compliance):**
- Create PatientHistory record for each merge operation
- Log: document_id, resource types merged, resource counts, timestamp
- Log: action='fhir_merge', fhir_delta=resources merged
- This maintains complete traceability for compliance

## 7. Implement rollback_document_merge method in Patient model [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.6
### Description: Create a method to surgically remove FHIR resources associated with a specific document using source filtering.
### Details:
Add rollback_document_merge(document_id) method to the Patient model with the following implementation:

**Source Filtering Strategy:**
- Filter FHIR bundle to remove ALL resources where meta.source = "document_{document_id}"
- This surgically removes only the target document's resources without affecting other data
- Preserves all resources from other documents

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Django's transaction.atomic() for atomicity
- Iterate through patient's encrypted_fhir_bundle['entry']
- Keep resources where meta.source != "document_{document_id}"
- Remove resources where meta.source == "document_{document_id}"
- Return count of removed resources

**Audit Trail (HIPAA Compliance):**
- Create PatientHistory record for each rollback operation
- Log: document_id, resource types removed, resource counts, timestamp
- Log: action='fhir_rollback', notes=f"Rolled back {count} resources from document {document_id}"
- This maintains complete traceability for compliance

**Error Handling:**
- If document_id not found in any resources, return 0 (idempotent)
- If bundle is empty or malformed, handle gracefully
- Log all operations for debugging
