# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement Optimistic Concurrency Merge System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transform the document processing pipeline from a pessimistic locking model to an optimistic concurrency model that merges data immediately and flags exceptions for review. This architectural shift removes the human bottleneck that prevents clinical staff from accessing parsed medical data in real-time, while maintaining data quality through intelligent automated flagging and surgical rollback capabilities.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive optimistic concurrency system with the following components:

1. **Data Model Changes**:
   - Add `auto_approved` (BooleanField) and `flag_reason` (TextField) to ParsedData model
   - Update REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES to the 5-state machine: 'pending', 'auto_approved', 'flagged', 'reviewed', 'rejected'
   - Add methods `determine_review_status()` and `check_quick_conflicts()`
   - Add indexes on `auto_approved` and `(review_status, created_at)`

2. **Patient Model Enhancements**:
   - Implement `update_fhir_resources(fhir_resources, document_id)` method for idempotent merges
   - Implement `rollback_document_merge(document_id)` for surgical removal of resources
   - Use Django's transaction management to ensure atomicity
   - Ensure meta.source tagging for document traceability

3. **Quality Check Logic**:
   - Implement flag conditions in `determine_review_status()`:
     - Extraction confidence < 0.80
     - Fallback AI model used
     - Zero resources extracted
     - Fewer than 3 resources AND confidence < 0.95
     - DOB/name conflicts with patient record
   - Optimize for < 100ms performance on quick checks

4. **Task Flow Modification**:
   - Update `process_document_async` in tasks.py to implement immediate merge
   - Call `determine_review_status()` and then merge regardless of flag status
   - Set appropriate status flags and handle errors gracefully

5. **Data Migration**:
   - Create migration to map existing records to new status system
   - Test thoroughly on staging data before deployment

6. **Test Coverage**:
   - Unit tests for quality check logic, FHIR operations
   - Integration tests for the entire workflow
   - Performance tests for merge operations (< 500ms target)
   - Retry safety tests for idempotency

7. **Staging Deployment & Monitoring**:
   - Deploy to staging and process test documents
   - Monitor flag rates (5-20% target) and tune thresholds
   - Validate merge performance and failure rates

8. **Flagged Items UI**:
   - Create dashboard widget showing flagged count
   - Build flagged items list view and detail/verification view
   - Implement actions: Mark as Correct, Correct Data, Rollback Merge

9. **Cleanup Old Review Workflow**:
   - Remove obsolete code and templates
   - Update documentation
   - Deploy to production

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Use Django 4.2+ for the latest ORM features and performance improvements
- Leverage Django's transaction.atomic() for FHIR operations
- Use Django-FHIR (fhirstore 2.x) for FHIR resource handling
- Implement Celery task idempotency using unique task IDs
- Use Django signals for audit trail creation
- Consider using Django REST Framework 3.14+ for the flagged items API
- Implement proper exception handling with contextual error messages
- Use Django's select_related() and prefetch_related() to optimize queries
- Consider adding Redis caching for frequently accessed patient data

**Libraries and Versions:**
- Django 4.2+
- Celery 5.3+
- Django REST Framework 3.14+
- fhirstore 2.x
- django-auditlog 2.2+ for audit trails
- django-filter 23.1+ for flagged items filtering
- pytest 7.3+ for testing

**Database Considerations:**
- Add appropriate indexes for performance
- Use Django's F() expressions to prevent race conditions
- Consider partial indexes for flagged items
- Use select_for_update() where appropriate for concurrent operations

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each flag condition in isolation
   - Test resource matching logic in update_fhir_resources()
   - Test rollback filtering logic
   - Test performance of quick checks (< 100ms)

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end document processing with immediate merge
   - Test retry safety (run task twice, verify no duplicates)
   - Test flagged documents still merge successfully
   - Test rollback removes only target document's resources

3. **Test Data**:
   - Create fixtures for various document types:
     - High confidence document (should auto-approve)
     - Low confidence document (should flag)
     - Document with DOB conflict (should flag)
     - Document with zero resources (should flag)

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Benchmark merge operations (target: < 500ms)
   - Test with large FHIR bundles (100+ resources)
   - Test concurrent merges (10+ simultaneous)

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Verify existing document processing still works
   - Verify audit trail completeness
   - Verify no data loss during migration

6. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify clinicians can see data within 5 minutes
   - Verify data stewards can efficiently review flagged items
   - Verify compliance officers can access audit trail

7. **Monitoring Tests**:
   - Set up metrics collection for flag rates
   - Set up alerts for high flag rates or merge failures
   - Verify threshold tuning works as expected

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add auto_approved and flag_reason fields to ParsedData model [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the ParsedData model to include auto_approved as a BooleanField and flag_reason as a TextField to support the optimistic concurrency model.
### Details:
In models.py, add auto_approved = models.BooleanField(default=False) and flag_reason = models.TextField(null=True, blank=True) to the ParsedData model. Set appropriate default values and ensure they can be null/blank when appropriate.
<info added on 2025-12-02T16:36:41.243Z>
Added `auto_approved` BooleanField (with database index) and `flag_reason` TextField to the ParsedData model in models.py. Created and applied migration 0013_add_optimistic_concurrency_fields. Implemented comprehensive test coverage in test_optimistic_concurrency.py with 11 tests. Fixed development.py configuration to default to PostgreSQL. All changes verified in the Docker PostgreSQL database with 100% test coverage for the new functionality.
</info added on 2025-12-02T16:36:41.243Z>

## 2. Update REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES in ParsedData model [done]
### Dependencies: 41.1
### Description: Modify the REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES to implement the 5-state machine: 'pending', 'auto_approved', 'flagged', 'reviewed', 'rejected'.
### Details:
In models.py, update the REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES tuple to include all five states with appropriate display names. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code by maintaining the same choice keys where possible.
<info added on 2025-12-02T16:36:59.688Z>
## Implementation Complete - Task 41.2

**What We Built:**
- Updated REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES from 4-state to 5-state machine
- Replaced 'approved' with 'reviewed' and added 'auto_approved'
- Updated approve_extraction() method to set 'reviewed' status
- Updated admin action for backward compatibility
- Created migration 0014_update_review_status_choices_5state

**5-State Machine:**
1. pending → Initial state after extraction
2. auto_approved → High confidence, merged immediately (NEW)
3. flagged → Needs manual review
4. reviewed → Manually approved by human (replaces 'approved')
5. rejected → Rejected by human reviewer

**State Transitions:**
- pending → auto_approved (high confidence, no conflicts)
- pending → flagged (low confidence, conflicts, issues)
- flagged → reviewed (human verified)
- flagged → rejected (human rejected)
- auto_approved → reviewed (optional verification)
- auto_approved → rejected (issues found after auto-approval)

**Test Coverage:**
- Added ReviewStatusChoicesTests class with 21 tests
- Tests cover: all 5 states, transitions, methods, queries, validation
- Invalid status values properly rejected
- Old 'approved' status no longer valid
- All 21 tests passing
- Test strictness: 4/5

**Files Modified:**
1. apps/documents/models.py - Updated REVIEW_STATUS_CHOICES + approve_extraction()
2. apps/documents/admin.py - Updated admin action
3. apps/documents/migrations/0014_update_review_status_choices_5state.py - Migration
4. apps/documents/tests/test_optimistic_concurrency.py - 21 tests

**Total Tests:** 32 passing (11 from 41.1 + 21 from 41.2)

## 3. Add determine_review_status method to ParsedData model [done]
### Dependencies: 41.2
### Description: Implement a method that determines whether a document should be auto-approved or flagged based on quality check criteria.
### Details:
Add a determine_review_status() method to the ParsedData model that evaluates extraction confidence, model type, resource count, and patient data conflicts. Return the appropriate status ('auto_approved' or 'flagged') and reason if flagged.
<info added on 2025-12-02T16:37:18.244Z>
The determine_review_status() method has been implemented in the ParsedData model. The method evaluates five quality criteria to determine whether a parsed document should be auto-approved or flagged for review:

1. Extraction confidence below 0.80 results in flagging
2. Documents processed using fallback AI models are flagged
3. Documents with zero extracted resources are flagged
4. Documents with fewer than 3 resources AND confidence below 0.95 are flagged
5. Documents with patient data conflicts (detected via check_quick_conflicts) are flagged

The method follows a sequential check pattern, where checks run in order (confidence → fallback → resources → conflicts). The first failing check triggers flagging with a detailed reason. If all checks pass, the document is marked as auto_approved with an empty reason string.

The implementation returns a tuple in the format (status, reason) for transparency, where status is either 'auto_approved' or 'flagged' and reason contains the specific quality check that failed.

Performance was a key consideration, with the method executing in under 100ms. The implementation uses lightweight checks before more expensive operations to optimize for high-throughput document processing.

Test coverage includes 13 new tests in the DetermineReviewStatusTests class, covering all flag conditions, boundary cases, performance requirements, and validation of auto-approval logic for both list and dict FHIR formats.

## 4. Add check_quick_conflicts method to ParsedData model [done]
### Dependencies: 41.3
### Description: Implement a method to quickly check for conflicts between parsed data and existing patient records.
### Details:
Add a check_quick_conflicts() method that compares extracted patient identifiers (name, DOB) with existing patient records. Optimize for performance (<100ms). Return boolean indicating conflict and reason if found.
<info added on 2025-12-02T16:37:38.425Z>
## Implementation Complete

**What We Built:**
- Implemented check_quick_conflicts() method for fast patient data validation
- Added 2 helper methods for FHIR patient demographic extraction
- Integrated conflict check into determine_review_status() as Check #5

**Methods Implemented:**
1. check_quick_conflicts() - Main conflict detection
2. _extract_patient_demographics_from_fhir() - Extracts demographics from FHIR
3. _parse_fhir_patient_resource() - Parses FHIR Patient resource

**Conflict Detection Logic:**
- DOB mismatch: Exact match required between extracted and patient record
- Name mismatch: Fuzzy matching with smart partial match logic
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Handles middle names, initials, variations
- Only flags completely different names

**Smart Name Matching:**
- 'John Doe' matches 'John Michael Doe' (middle name) ✅
- 'John Doe' matches 'J Doe' (initial) ✅
- 'JOHN DOE' matches 'john doe' (case) ✅
- 'John Doe' does NOT match 'Jane Smith' (different) ❌

**FHIR Format Support:**
- List format: [{'resourceType': 'Patient', ...}]
- Dict format: {'Patient': [{'resourceType': 'Patient', ...}]}
- Handles missing Patient resource gracefully

**Integration:**
- Integrated into determine_review_status() as final check
- Two-layer protection: quick check + full ConflictDetector during merge
- Complementary, not redundant

**Test Coverage:**
- Added CheckQuickConflictsTests class with 12 tests
- Tests cover: matching, DOB conflicts, name conflicts, variations, performance
- Performance validated: <100ms execution
- Integration with determine_review_status verified
- All 12 tests passing

<info added on 2025-12-02T16:37:57.170Z>
## Implementation Complete - Task 41.5

**What We Built:**
- Added composite index on (review_status, created_at) to ParsedData model
- Created migration 0015_add_review_status_created_index
- Applied migration to Docker PostgreSQL database

**Indexes Summary:**
Both required indexes now exist:
1. auto_approved index (created in migration 0013) - Single field index
2. (review_status, created_at) composite index (created in migration 0015) - Composite index

**Index Details:**
- Name: parsed_review_status_idx
- Fields: review_status, created_at
- Type: btree
- Purpose: Optimize flagged items dashboard queries

**Performance Benefits:**
- Fast filtering by review_status (flagged, pending, auto_approved, etc.)
- Efficient time-based queries (e.g., "flagged in last 7 days")
- Optimized sorting by created_at within status groups
- Scalable as data volume grows

**Test Coverage:**
- Added DatabaseIndexTests class with 6 tests
- Tests verify: indexes exist, queries use indexes, performance
- Performance test: Flagged items query <100ms with 50 records
- All 6 tests passing
- Test strictness: 4/5

**Database Verification:**
Confirmed in PostgreSQL:
- parsed_data_auto_approved_0786de7f btree (auto_approved)
- parsed_review_status_idx btree (review_status, created_at)

**Files Modified:**
1. apps/documents/models.py - Added composite index to Meta.indexes
2. apps/documents/migrations/0015_add_review_status_created_index.py - Migration

## 6. Implement update_fhir_resources method in Patient model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a method to handle idempotent merging of FHIR resources into the patient record using composite key matching.
### Details:
Add update_fhir_resources(fhir_resources, document_id) method to the Patient model with the following implementation:

**Composite Key Matching Strategy:**
- Match existing resources using (meta.source, resourceType) tuple to identify duplicates
- This ensures idempotency - if the same document is processed twice, resources are updated rather than duplicated
- For each incoming resource:
  * Check if (meta.source, resourceType) already exists in patient's bundle
  * If exists: UPDATE the existing resource
  * If new: APPEND to bundle

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Django's transaction.atomic() for atomicity
- Tag all resources with meta.source = "document_{document_id}"
- Tag all resources with meta.lastUpdated = current timestamp
- Tag all resources with meta.versionId = UUID

**Audit Trail (HIPAA Compliance):**
- Create PatientHistory record for each merge operation
- Log: document_id, resource types merged, resource counts, timestamp
- Log: action='fhir_merge', fhir_delta=resources merged
- This maintains complete traceability for compliance

## 7. Implement rollback_document_merge method in Patient model [pending]
### Dependencies: 41.6
### Description: Create a method to surgically remove FHIR resources associated with a specific document using source filtering.
### Details:
Add rollback_document_merge(document_id) method to the Patient model with the following implementation:

**Source Filtering Strategy:**
- Filter FHIR bundle to remove ALL resources where meta.source = "document_{document_id}"
- This surgically removes only the target document's resources without affecting other data
- Preserves all resources from other documents

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Django's transaction.atomic() for atomicity
- Iterate through patient's encrypted_fhir_bundle['entry']
- Keep resources where meta.source != "document_{document_id}"
- Remove resources where meta.source == "document_{document_id}"
- Return count of removed resources

**Audit Trail (HIPAA Compliance):**
- Create PatientHistory record for each rollback operation
- Log: document_id, resource types removed, resource counts, timestamp
- Log: action='fhir_rollback', notes=f"Rolled back {count} resources from document {document_id}"
- This maintains complete traceability for compliance

**Error Handling:**
- If document_id not found in any resources, return 0 (idempotent)
- If bundle is empty or malformed, handle gracefully
- Log all operations for debugging
