# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Django Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Django project with the proper app structure according to the PRD, including all required apps and basic configuration.
# Details:
Create a new Django 5.0 project with the following structure:
- Create main project folder 'meddocparser'
- Setup settings module with base.py, development.py, and production.py
- Create apps folder with the following Django apps:
  - accounts (user auth & profiles)
  - core (shared utilities)
  - documents (document upload/processing)
  - patients (patient management)
  - providers (provider management)
  - fhir (FHIR processing)
  - reports (reporting module)
- Setup static and template directories
- Configure PostgreSQL with JSONB support
- Setup Redis and Celery for async processing
- Create docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile
- Initialize requirements.txt with all dependencies listed in PRD
- Configure Django settings for HIPAA compliance basics

Code example for settings/base.py:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    # Third-party apps
    'rest_framework',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'django_htmx',
    'tailwind',
    # Local apps
    'apps.accounts',
    'apps.core',
    'apps.documents',
    'apps.patients',
    'apps.providers',
    'apps.fhir',
    'apps.reports',
]
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure is correct by running:
- `python manage.py check` to ensure no errors
- `python manage.py runserver` to verify server starts
- Test database connection
- Verify Celery worker connects to Redis
- Run Docker Compose to ensure all services start correctly
- Create a simple view to test the basic configuration

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Main Project Folder [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the Django project with the main folder 'meddocparser'.
### Details:
Use Django's startproject command to create the basic structure.

## 2. Setup Settings Module [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create settings module with base.py, development.py, and production.py.
### Details:
Organize settings for different environments.
<info added on 2025-06-16T02:05:51.499Z>
**What we accomplished:**
- Created organized settings module structure: base.py, development.py, production.py
- Set up HIPAA-compliant security settings in base.py
- Configured development-friendly settings for local work
- Configured production-ready settings with PostgreSQL and enhanced security
- Updated manage.py to use development settings by default
- Updated wsgi.py and asgi.py to use production settings
- Installed python-decouple for environment variable management
- Created logs directory for Django logging
- Created cursor rule for virtual environment management to prevent future global package installations

**Key files created:**
- meddocparser/settings/__init__.py
- meddocparser/settings/base.py (with HIPAA security configs)
- meddocparser/settings/development.py (SQLite, debug mode)
- meddocparser/settings/production.py (PostgreSQL, strict security)
- .cursor/rules/venv_management.mdc (prevents global installs)
- logs/ directory

**Settings verification:**
Django check command expected to fail at this stage because third-party apps (rest_framework, django_htmx, etc.) and local apps aren't created yet. This is normal progression - settings structure is correct.

## 3. Create Apps Folder with Required Apps [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create apps folder with necessary Django apps.
### Details:
Include accounts, core, documents, patients, providers, fhir, and reports apps.
<info added on 2025-06-16T02:15:44.577Z>
✅ COMPLETED Django Apps Creation

**What we accomplished:**
- Created apps/ directory with proper Python module structure
- Successfully created all 7 required Django apps using django-admin startapp:
  - accounts/ (user auth & profiles)
  - core/ (shared utilities) 
  - documents/ (document upload/processing)
  - patients/ (patient management)
  - providers/ (provider management)
  - fhir/ (FHIR processing)
  - reports/ (reporting module)
- Added __init__.py to apps/ directory to make it a proper Python module
- Verified Django can recognize our custom apps (error changed from missing apps to missing third-party packages)

**Directory structure created:**
```
apps/
├── __init__.py
├── accounts/
├── core/
├── documents/
├── patients/
├── providers/
├── fhir/
└── reports/
```

**Django verification:**
Django check command now recognizes our apps correctly - the error has shifted from "No module named apps.accounts" to "No module named rest_framework", confirming our apps structure is working.

**Next steps:**
Third-party packages (rest_framework, django_htmx, etc.) will be installed in later subtasks. Our apps are ready and properly configured in settings.

  - static/js/ (with base.js including HIPAA-compliant session management)
  - static/img/ (for images and icons)
  - static/fonts/ (for custom fonts)

- Created templates/ directory with:

**Template structure:**
- Navigation bar with authenticated user menu
- Message system for notifications
- Footer with security notices
- Extensible blocks for app-specific content
- Integration with htmx and Alpine.js for dynamic functionality

**Next steps:**
Static and template foundation is ready for building app-specific views and functionality.

## 5. Configure PostgreSQL with JSONB Support [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up PostgreSQL database with JSONB support.
### Details:
Ensure the database is configured correctly in settings.
<info added on 2025-06-16T02:34:14.392Z>
# Database Configuration

## PostgreSQL with JSONB Support Configuration

### What we accomplished:
- **Installed PostgreSQL adapter:** Successfully installed psycopg2-binary for Django-PostgreSQL integration
- **Enhanced database configuration:** Updated development.py to support both SQLite (default) and PostgreSQL via DB_ENGINE environment variable
- **Verified configuration working:** Database selection logic functioning correctly (confirmed by "💾 Using SQLite database for development" message)
- **Created comprehensive JSONB utilities:** Built FHIRJSONBManager and PostgreSQLJSONBQueries classes for medical data handling
- **Environment configuration:** Created env.example template with database configuration options

### Key features implemented:
- **Flexible database backend:** Developers can use SQLite for quick development or PostgreSQL for JSONB testing
- **FHIR-specific utilities:** Complete toolkit for handling FHIR Bundles, resources, and PostgreSQL JSONB operations
- **Medical data focus:** Utilities designed specifically for cumulative patient records and medical document processing
- **Production-ready:** PostgreSQL configuration already set up in production.py with SSL and security settings

### Database configurations:
- **Development (default):** SQLite for simplicity
- **Development (optional):** PostgreSQL with JSONB for testing FHIR features
- **Production:** PostgreSQL with SSL, JSONB, and HIPAA-compliant security

### JSONB capabilities demonstrated:
- FHIR Bundle creation and management
- Resource validation and provenance tracking
- Type-based resource extraction
- PostgreSQL-specific query optimization (when using PostgreSQL backend)

### Next steps:
Database foundation ready for building medical models with JSONB fields for FHIR data storage. Third-party package installation (causing current import errors) is scheduled for later subtasks.
