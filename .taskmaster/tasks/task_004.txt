# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Provider Management Module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and polish the provider management functionality including provider profiles, linking to patients and documents, and provider directory. Ensure the module is production-ready with complete UI polish and error handling.
# Details:
Implement the provider management module:

1. Create Provider model with fields as specified in PRD:
```python
class Provider(models.Model):
    npi = models.CharField(max_length=10, unique=True, verbose_name="NPI Number")
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    specialty = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    organization = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Dr. {self.first_name} {self.last_name} ({self.specialty})"
    
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        return reverse('providers:detail', kwargs={'pk': self.pk})
        
    def get_patients(self):
        """Return all patients linked to this provider through documents"""
        return Patient.objects.filter(
            documents__document_providers__provider=self
        ).distinct()
```

2. Create DocumentProvider model for linking providers to documents:
```python
class DocumentProvider(models.Model):
    RELATIONSHIP_CHOICES = [
        ('attending', 'Attending'),
        ('consulting', 'Consulting'),
        ('referring', 'Referring'),
        ('other', 'Other'),
    ]
    
    document = models.ForeignKey('documents.Document', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    provider = models.ForeignKey(Provider, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    relationship_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=RELATIONSHIP_CHOICES)
    
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['document', 'provider']
```

3. Implement views for:
   - Provider list with search/filter
   - Provider detail showing linked patients
   - Provider create/edit forms
   - Provider directory with specialties

4. Create templates for provider management
5. Implement provider search functionality
6. Create function to view all patients for a provider
7. Setup URL patterns for provider module
8. Add comprehensive UI polish and error handling for production readiness

Example provider detail view:
```python
class ProviderDetailView(LoginRequiredMixin, DetailView):
    model = Provider
    template_name = 'providers/provider_detail.html'
    context_object_name = 'provider'
    
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        context['patients'] = self.object.get_patients()
        context['documents'] = Document.objects.filter(
            document_providers__provider=self.object
        ).order_by('-uploaded_at')
        return context
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for Provider model methods
2. Test provider creation with valid/invalid data
3. Test provider search functionality
4. Verify provider-patient relationships
5. Test provider directory filtering
6. Verify document-provider linking
7. Test relationship type tracking
8. Integration tests for provider workflow
9. Test error handling and user feedback mechanisms
10. Verify UI responsiveness and accessibility compliance
