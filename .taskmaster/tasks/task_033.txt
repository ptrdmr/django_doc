# Task ID: 33
# Title: Enable FHIR-Focused Extraction and Enhance Processing Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 21, 30
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the system to use existing FHIR extraction capabilities and enhance the processing pipeline for improved FHIR compliance and data structure.
# Details:
Implement the FHIR Bundle Structure Improvements with the following steps:

1. Enable FHIR-focused extraction:
   - In `services.py`, locate the `DocumentAnalyzer` class and change `fhir_focused=False` to `fhir_focused=True`.

2. Update FHIR converter to handle both old and new formats:
   ```python
   def convert_to_fhir(extracted_data):
       if isinstance(extracted_data, str):
           # Handle old format (concatenated string)
           return legacy_string_to_fhir(extracted_data)
       elif isinstance(extracted_data, list):
           # Handle new format (structured arrays)
           return structured_array_to_fhir(extracted_data)
       else:
           raise ValueError("Unsupported data format")
   ```

3. Enhance temporal data processing:
   ```python
   def process_temporal_data(fhir_resource):
       if 'effectiveDateTime' in fhir_resource:
           fhir_resource['effectiveDateTime'] = parse_and_format_date(fhir_resource['effectiveDateTime'])
       # Add similar processing for other date fields
       return fhir_resource
   ```

4. Create data migration strategy:
   - Write a Django management command to reprocess existing records:
   ```python
   from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
   from patients.models import Patient

   class Command(BaseCommand):
       help = 'Reprocess existing patient records with FHIR-focused extraction'

       def handle(self, *args, **options):
           for patient in Patient.objects.all():
               patient.reprocess_documents()
               self.stdout.write(f"Reprocessed patient {patient.id}")
   ```

5. Update the `Patient.add_fhir_resources()` method to handle the new structured format:
   ```python
   def add_fhir_resources(self, new_resources):
       existing_bundle = json.loads(self.fhir_data)
       for resource in new_resources:
           resource_type = resource['resourceType']
           existing_resources = [r for r in existing_bundle['entry'] if r['resource']['resourceType'] == resource_type]
           if not any(r['resource'] == resource for r in existing_resources):
               existing_bundle['entry'].append({'resource': resource})
       self.fhir_data = json.dumps(existing_bundle)
       self.save()
   ```

6. Implement comprehensive testing and validation:
   - Create unit tests for the new FHIR extraction and processing functions.
   - Implement integration tests to ensure the entire pipeline works correctly.
   - Set up automated FHIR validation using the FHIR validator tool.

7. Update documentation and API endpoints to reflect the new FHIR-focused approach.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test the `convert_to_fhir` function with both old and new format inputs.
   - Verify `process_temporal_data` correctly handles various date formats.
   - Test `Patient.add_fhir_resources()` with the new structured format.

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create a test document and run it through the entire extraction and processing pipeline.
   - Verify that the resulting FHIR bundle is correctly structured and contains all expected resources.

3. Migration Testing:
   - Run the data migration command on a test dataset.
   - Compare the before and after states of patient records to ensure correct conversion.

4. FHIR Compliance:
   - Use the official FHIR validator tool to check the output of the system for compliance.
   - Test with various document types to ensure broad coverage.

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure the processing time for documents before and after the changes.
   - Ensure that the new approach does not significantly impact system performance.

6. Edge Case Testing:
   - Test with documents containing minimal or no extractable data.
   - Verify handling of documents with conflicting or duplicate information.

7. API Testing:
   - Update and test any API endpoints that interact with the FHIR data to ensure they handle the new structure correctly.

8. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Have clinical staff review a sample of processed documents to verify accuracy and completeness of extraction.

9. Regression Testing:
   - Run the full suite of existing tests to ensure no unintended side effects on other system components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enable FHIR-focused extraction in DocumentAnalyzer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the DocumentAnalyzer class in services.py to enable FHIR-focused extraction
### Details:
In services.py, locate the DocumentAnalyzer class and change fhir_focused=False to fhir_focused=True. This is a critical one-line change that enables FHIR extraction.
<info added on 2025-09-14T19:02:20.890Z>
✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

**File Modified:** `apps/documents/services.py`
**Line Changed:** 1402
**Change Made:** 
```python
# BEFORE:
fhir_focused=False,  # Use clean extraction format for UI display

# AFTER:  
fhir_focused=True,  # Enable FHIR-focused extraction for proper resource arrays and temporal data
```

**Impact:** This single line change switches the system from using `MEDIEXTRACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (which returns concatenated strings like "Hypertension; Diabetes; Heart murmur") to using `FHIR_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` (which returns structured arrays with proper temporal data).

**What This Enables:**
- Individual FHIR resources instead of concatenated text
- Automatic extraction of temporal data (diagnosis dates, medication start dates)
- Proper FHIR resource structure with arrays
- Enhanced metadata extraction capabilities

**Next Steps:** Need to test this change and then proceed to subtask 33.2 to update FHIR converter compatibility.

## 2. Update FHIR converter for compatibility [done]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Modify the convert_to_fhir function to handle both old and new data formats
### Details:
In the file containing FHIR conversion logic, update the convert_to_fhir function to handle both string (old format) and list (new format) inputs. Implement the legacy_string_to_fhir and structured_array_to_fhir functions to process each format accordingly.
<info added on 2025-09-14T19:05:41.603Z>
Implementation completed successfully. The FHIR converter has been updated to support both legacy and new FHIR-structured formats with full backward compatibility. The implementation includes an enhanced main method for format detection and routing, a new format detection function, dedicated converters for both FHIR-structured and legacy formats, and six new resource creation methods. Key features include temporal data support, individual resource creation, full backward compatibility, comprehensive error handling, and rich metadata preservation. This update enables the system to properly handle the FHIR-structured extraction format while maintaining compatibility with existing data.

## 3. Enhance temporal data processing [done]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Implement a function to process and standardize temporal data in FHIR resources
### Details:
Create a process_temporal_data function that takes a FHIR resource as input and standardizes date fields like effectiveDateTime. Implement parse_and_format_date to handle various date formats and convert them to a standard FHIR-compliant format.
<info added on 2025-09-14T19:07:32.405Z>
**Enhanced Temporal Data Processing:** Added comprehensive temporal data processing utilities to handle date standardization across all FHIR resources.

**New Functions Added:**

1. **`process_temporal_data(fhir_resource)`**:
   - Standardizes all temporal fields in FHIR resources
   - Handles resource-specific date fields (onsetDateTime, effectiveDateTime, etc.)
   - Processes period objects (start/end dates)
   - Non-destructive processing (copies resource before modification)

2. **`parse_and_format_date(date_input)`**:
   - Converts various date formats to FHIR-compliant ISO 8601
   - Supports MM/DD/YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, natural language dates
   - Uses dateutil for flexible parsing fallback
   - Handles datetime objects and date objects

3. **`_is_iso8601_format(date_str)`**:
   - Validates if date string is already ISO 8601 compliant
   - Supports various ISO 8601 patterns with/without timezone
   - Prevents unnecessary re-processing of compliant dates

4. **`_process_period_data(period_data)`**:
   - Specialized handling for FHIR period objects
   - Processes both start and end dates
   - Maintains period structure integrity

5. **`validate_fhir_temporal_compliance(fhir_resource)`**:
   - Validates temporal field compliance with FHIR specs
   - Returns detailed validation results with errors/warnings
   - Useful for quality assurance and debugging

**Integration:** These utilities are automatically used by the new structured resource creation methods and can be called independently for post-processing existing FHIR resources.

**Benefits:**
- Consistent ISO 8601 date formatting across all resources
- Flexible input date format handling
- Comprehensive validation capabilities
- Enhanced data quality and FHIR compliance
