# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement FHIR Resource Alignment for Pydantic Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 30, 35
# Priority: high
# Description: Achieve complete alignment between AI extraction Pydantic models and FHIR processing services to eliminate data loss during document processing, increasing resource type alignment from 6/12 to 12/12.
# Details:
Implement the FHIR resource alignment in four phases:

PHASE 1: Update Existing Services and Create New Ones (Target: 8/12 alignment)
1. Update 4 existing FHIR services to accept structured Pydantic input:
   - Modify `ConditionService` in `apps/fhir/services/condition_service.py`
   - Modify `MedicationService` in `apps/fhir/services/medication_service.py`
   - Modify `ObservationService` in `apps/fhir/services/observation_service.py`
   - Modify `EncounterService` in `apps/fhir/services/encounter_service.py`
   - Add dual-format support with structured Pydantic-derived dicts as primary and legacy fields as fallback

2. Create 2 new services for existing Pydantic models:
   - Implement `ProcedureService` in `apps/fhir/services/procedure_service.py`
   - Implement `PractitionerService` in `apps/fhir/services/practitioner_service.py`

3. Update `FHIRProcessor` in `apps/fhir/services/fhir_processor.py` to wire in new services
4. Update `FHIRMetricsService` for dynamic resource detection

PHASE 2: Create New Pydantic Models and Update Services (Target: 11/12 alignment)
1. Create 3 new Pydantic models in `apps/documents/services/ai_extraction.py`:
   - `Encounter` model with full field schema
   - `ServiceRequest` model with full field schema
   - `DiagnosticReport` model with full field schema

2. Update AI extraction system prompt to instruct LLM to extract these types
3. Update 3 existing FHIR services to process new structured models

PHASE 3: Complete Alignment with Final Models (Target: 12/12 alignment)
1. Create 3 final Pydantic models in `apps/documents/services/ai_extraction.py`:
   - `AllergyIntolerance` model with full field schema
   - `CarePlan` model with full field schema
   - `Organization` model with full field schema

2. Update AI prompt for new model extraction
3. Create 3 corresponding FHIR services:
   - `AllergyIntoleranceService` in `apps/fhir/services/allergy_intolerance_service.py`
   - `CarePlanService` in `apps/fhir/services/care_plan_service.py`
   - `OrganizationService` in `apps/fhir/services/organization_service.py`

4. Wire all new services into `FHIRProcessor`

PHASE 4: Pipeline Configuration and Validation
1. Ensure structured path is primary in pipeline configuration
2. Add comprehensive logging for observability
3. Run validation suite on 20-30 sample documents
4. Update documentation

Technical Requirements:
- All services must support dual-format: structured Pydantic-derived dicts (primary) and legacy fields (fallback)
- Use `ClinicalDateParser` from Task #35 for all date handling to ensure consistency
- Maintain test coverage ≥95% on all new/modified code
- Ensure AI extraction recall ≥85% for each resource type
- Prevent regression on existing functionality
- Follow unittest.TestCase framework for all tests

# Test Strategy:
To verify the correct implementation of the FHIR resource alignment:

1. Unit Tests for Each Phase:
   - Create test cases for each updated and new FHIR service:
     ```python
     from django.test import TestCase
     from apps.fhir.services.condition_service import ConditionService
     
     class ConditionServiceTests(TestCase):
         def setUp(self):
             self.service = ConditionService()
             self.pydantic_data = {...}  # Sample Pydantic-derived dict
             self.legacy_data = {...}    # Sample legacy format dict
             
         def test_process_pydantic_data(self):
             fhir_resource = self.service.process(self.pydantic_data)
             self.assertIsNotNone(fhir_resource)
             self.assertEqual(fhir_resource.resource_type, "Condition")
             # Verify all expected fields are present
             
         def test_process_legacy_data(self):
             fhir_resource = self.service.process(self.legacy_data)
             self.assertIsNotNone(fhir_resource)
             # Verify fallback processing works correctly
     ```
   - Repeat similar tests for all 12 services

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test the complete pipeline from AI extraction to FHIR resource creation:
     ```python
     def test_extraction_to_fhir_pipeline(self):
         # Mock AI extraction response
         extraction_result = {...}  # Sample extraction with all 12 resource types
         
         # Process through FHIRProcessor
         processor = FHIRProcessor()
         fhir_resources = processor.process_extraction(extraction_result)
         
         # Verify all expected resource types are present
         resource_types = [r.resource_type for r in fhir_resources]
         self.assertIn("Condition", resource_types)
         self.assertIn("Medication", resource_types)
         # Check all 12 types
     ```

3. Data Loss Tests:
   - Create tests specifically to verify no data is lost during conversion:
     ```python
     def test_no_data_loss_during_conversion(self):
         # Create a complex Pydantic model instance with all fields populated
         complex_model = ComplexPydanticModel(...)
         
         # Process through appropriate service
         service = RelevantService()
         fhir_resource = service.process(complex_model.dict())
         
         # Verify all fields from the model are represented in the FHIR resource
         self.assertIn(complex_model.field1, fhir_resource.as_json())
         # Check all fields
     ```

4. Regression Tests:
   - Ensure existing functionality continues to work:
     ```python
     def test_existing_functionality_preserved(self):
         # Use known test cases from before the changes
         legacy_input = {...}  # Input that worked before changes
         
         # Process through updated service
         result = updated_service.process(legacy_input)
         
         # Verify output matches expected pre-change output
         self.assertEqual(result, expected_output)
     ```

5. End-to-End Tests:
   - Run the complete document processing pipeline on 20-30 sample documents
   - Verify all 12 resource types are correctly extracted and processed
   - Measure extraction recall for each resource type (target ≥85%)
   - Check for any data loss between extraction and final FHIR resources

6. Performance Tests:
   - Measure processing time before and after changes
   - Ensure no significant performance degradation

7. Manual Validation:
   - Perform manual review of a subset of processed documents
   - Compare extracted data with source documents
   - Verify correct handling of edge cases and complex medical terminology
