# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle the final integration between all polished modules and prepare the system for deployment, including cross-module testing, final performance optimization, deployment configuration, and system-wide integration verification.
# Details:
Implement the final system integration and deployment preparation:

1. Cross-Module Integration:
   - Create an integration test suite that verifies all modules work together correctly
   - Implement integration points between Patient Management, Provider Management, Document Processing, and Reports modules
   - Verify FHIR data flows correctly through the entire system pipeline
   - Ensure security components (RBAC, encryption, audit logging) are properly integrated with all modules

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Conduct database query optimization with proper indexing for all critical queries
   - Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
   - Profile application performance and optimize slow components
   - Configure Django settings for production environment:
   ```python
   # settings.py production optimizations
   DEBUG = False
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']
   
   # Cache configuration
   CACHES = {
       'default': {
           'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
           'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
       }
   }
   
   # Database connection pooling
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'production_db',
           'USER': 'db_user',
           'PASSWORD': 'db_password',
           'HOST': 'db.example.com',
           'PORT': '5432',
           'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600,  # 10 minutes connection persistence
       }
   }
   ```

3. Deployment Configuration:
   - Create deployment scripts for automated deployment
   - Implement Docker containerization:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   
   COPY . .
   
   RUN python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   
   EXPOSE 8000
   
   CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "config.wsgi:application"]
   ```
   - Configure Nginx as reverse proxy:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
       
       location /static/ {
           alias /app/static/;
       }
       
       location /media/ {
           alias /app/media/;
       }
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://web:8000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Create docker-compose.yml for orchestration:
   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   
   services:
     web:
       build: .
       restart: always
       depends_on:
         - db
         - redis
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
         - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
     
     db:
       image: postgres:13
       volumes:
         - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
         - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
         - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
     
     redis:
       image: redis:6
       
     celery:
       build: .
       command: celery -A config worker -l INFO
       depends_on:
         - web
         - redis
       
     nginx:
       image: nginx:1.19
       ports:
         - "80:80"
         - "443:443"
       volumes:
         - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
         - ./static:/app/static
         - ./media:/app/media
       depends_on:
         - web
   
   volumes:
     postgres_data:
   ```

# Test Strategy:
1. Integration Testing:
   - Create and execute comprehensive integration test suite covering all module interactions

   - Measure response times for critical operations under various load conditions
   - Verify database query performance with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   - Test memory usage and identify potential memory leaks
   - Validate that the system meets performance requirements specified in the PRD

3. Security Verification:
   - Conduct penetration testing to identify security vulnerabilities
   - Verify all HIPAA compliance requirements are met
   - Test role-based access controls to ensure proper permission enforcement
   - Verify audit logging captures all required events
   - Test data encryption for PHI at rest and in transit

4. Deployment Verification:

   - Verify static files are served correctly by Nginx
   - Test backup and restore procedures
   - Verify SSL/TLS configuration and certificate validity

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a UAT plan with specific test scenarios for stakeholders
   - Document and track all issues discovered during UAT
