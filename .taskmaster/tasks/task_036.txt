# Task ID: 36
# Title: Update Project Documentation with FHIR Data Capture Achievements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all project documentation to reflect the refactored document processing pipeline, enhanced FHIR resource capture, and comprehensive testing implementation from Task 34.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive documentation updates across the project repository:

1. README.md updates:
   - Add a new section titled "FHIR Data Capture Improvements"
   - Document the 95%+ FHIR data capture achievement (up from 23.8%)
   - Summarize the pipeline transformation with 12 implemented subtasks
   - Add badges showing test coverage and performance metrics

2. ARCHITECTURE.md updates:
   - Create a new diagram showing the refactored pipeline architecture
   - Document the new data flow from document upload to FHIR conversion
   - Add a section on the testing framework architecture
   - Update component interaction diagrams to reflect new pipeline

3. DEVELOPMENT.md updates:
   - Document the comprehensive testing suite (2,200+ lines of test code)
   - Add guidelines for writing tests for the new pipeline components
   - Document workflow patterns for the refactored pipeline
   - Include code examples for working with the new Pydantic validation

4. Create STATISTICS.md:
   ```markdown
   # Platform Performance Metrics
   
   ## FHIR Data Capture
   - Current capture rate: 95.2%
   - Previous capture rate: 23.8%
   - Improvement: 71.4 percentage points
   
   ## Performance Metrics
   - Document processing time: 40% reduction
   - Average processing time: X seconds
   - Peak throughput: Y documents per minute
   
   ## Testing Coverage
   - Total test lines: 2,200+
   - Test categories: 7
   - Code coverage: Z%
   ```

5. ROADMAP.md updates:
   - Update the roadmap to reflect Task 35 clinical date extraction planning
   - Adjust timeline based on completed Task 34 milestones
   - Add new planned features building on the refactored pipeline

6. API_DOCUMENTATION.md updates:
   - Document new pipeline endpoints
   - Add testing API documentation
   - Include request/response examples for all new endpoints
   - Update authentication and security sections

7. CHANGELOG.md entry:
   ```markdown
   ## [1.X.0] - YYYY-MM-DD
   
   ### Major Changes

   ```

8. Create a documentation index page that links to all updated documentation with a summary of changes.

9. Ensure all documentation follows a consistent style and formatting.

10. Add code examples where appropriate to demonstrate new pipeline usage.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the documentation updates:

1. Content Verification:
   - Review each updated document to ensure all required information is included
   - Verify that the 95%+ FHIR data capture achievement is accurately documented
   - Confirm that all 12 subtasks from Task 34 are properly reflected
   - Check that the testing framework with 7 test categories is fully documented
   - Ensure performance improvements (40% faster processing) are accurately reported

2. Technical Accuracy:
   - Have a technical team member review the documentation for accuracy
   - Verify that code examples are correct and follow project conventions
   - Ensure API documentation matches the actual implemented endpoints
   - Confirm that architecture diagrams accurately reflect the refactored pipeline

3. Completeness Check:
   - Create a checklist of all required documentation updates and verify each item
   - Ensure all seven documentation files are updated (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, STATISTICS.md, ROADMAP.md, API_DOCUMENTATION.md, CHANGELOG.md)
   - Verify that the new STATISTICS.md file contains all required metrics

4. Formatting and Style:
   - Check that all Markdown formatting is correct and renders properly on GitHub
   - Ensure consistent styling across all documentation files
   - Verify that links between documentation files work correctly
   - Test that code blocks are properly formatted with correct syntax highlighting

5. Peer Review:
   - Have at least two team members review the documentation changes
   - Collect feedback on clarity, completeness, and accuracy
   - Make revisions based on feedback

6. User Acceptance:
   - Share documentation with a sample of end users or stakeholders
   - Collect feedback on whether the documentation clearly explains the improvements
   - Verify that technical and non-technical readers can understand the achievements

7. Documentation Build Test:
   - If using a documentation generator (like Sphinx or MkDocs), ensure the build process completes without errors
   - Test that generated documentation displays correctly in browsers
