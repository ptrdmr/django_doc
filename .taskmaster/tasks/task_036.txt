# Task ID: 36
# Title: Update Project Documentation with FHIR Data Capture Achievements
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 34
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update all project documentation to reflect Task 34.11 achievements with 100% FHIR data capture, Task 35 planning for clinical data extraction, and document the new FHIR services architecture.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive documentation updates across the project repository:

1. Update README.md with Task 34.11 achievements:
```markdown
## Recent Achievements
- **100% FHIR Data Capture**: Successfully implemented complete FHIR resource capture for all medical document types
- **Enhanced Processing Pipeline**: Refactored core document processing for individual medical records
- **New FHIR Services**: Implemented dedicated condition_service.py and observation_service.py modules
```

2. Create/update ARCHITECTURE.md with new FHIR services directory structure:
```markdown
## FHIR Services Architecture

The system now implements a modular FHIR service approach with dedicated service modules:

```
fhir/
  services/
    base_service.py       # Base class for all FHIR services
    patient_service.py    # Patient resource handling
    condition_service.py  # Condition resource processing
    observation_service.py # Observation resource processing
    medication_service.py # Medication resource processing
```

Each service implements standardized interfaces for:
- Resource creation
- Resource validation
- Resource transformation
- FHIR Bundle integration
```

3. Update DEVELOPMENT.md with new workflow patterns:
```markdown
## Development Workflow

### TaskMaster Integration
All development work is now tracked through the TaskMaster system with:
- Granular implementation tasks
- Clear dependency management
- Integrated testing requirements

### Implementation Patterns
When implementing new FHIR services:
1. Create a dedicated service module in `fhir/services/`
2. Implement the standard service interface
3. Register the service in the FHIR registry
4. Add comprehensive tests for the service
```

4. Create/update STATISTICS.md with platform performance metrics:
```markdown
## Platform Statistics

### FHIR Data Capture
| Metric | Previous | Current |
|--------|----------|---------|
| FHIR Resource Capture | 78% | 100% |
| Processing Time | 3.2s | 2.8s |
| Validation Success | 92% | 98% |

### Resource Distribution
| Resource Type | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| Condition     | 12,450| 32% |
| Observation   | 18,320| 47% |
| Medication    | 8,230 | 21% |
```

5. Update ROADMAP.md with Task 35 planning:
```markdown
## Upcoming Development

### Clinical Data Extraction System (Task 35)
The next major development phase will focus on:
- Enhanced NLP for clinical term extraction
- Temporal relationship modeling between clinical events
- Automated clinical timeline generation
- Confidence scoring for extracted clinical data
- Integration with medical terminology services
```

6. Update API_DOCUMENTATION.md with new FHIR service endpoints:
```markdown
## FHIR Services API

### Condition Service
`POST /api/fhir/condition/`
Create a new condition resource

`GET /api/fhir/condition/{id}/`
Retrieve a specific condition

### Observation Service
`POST /api/fhir/observation/`
Create a new observation resource

`GET /api/fhir/observation/{id}/`
Retrieve a specific observation
```

7. Create a new CHANGELOG.md entry:
```markdown
## [1.5.0] - 2023-06-15

### Added
- 100% FHIR data capture capability
- New condition_service.py implementation
- New observation_service.py implementation
- Enhanced platform statistics dashboard
- TaskMaster integration for development workflow

### Changed
- Refactored FHIR services directory structure
- Updated architecture documentation
- Improved clinical data extraction pipeline
```

# Test Strategy:
To verify the documentation updates are complete and accurate:

1. Documentation Completeness Check:
   - Create a checklist of all documentation files that need updates:
     - README.md
     - ARCHITECTURE.md
     - DEVELOPMENT.md
     - STATISTICS.md
     - ROADMAP.md
     - API_DOCUMENTATION.md
     - CHANGELOG.md
   - Verify each file has been updated with the required information
   - Ensure all files use consistent terminology and formatting

2. Technical Accuracy Review:
   - Have a technical team member review the FHIR services architecture documentation
   - Verify that the described directory structure matches the actual codebase
   - Confirm that all new service endpoints are correctly documented
   - Validate that the platform statistics reflect actual system performance

3. Cross-Reference Validation:
   - Cross-reference Task 34.11 completion details with the documentation
   - Ensure all achievements from Task 34.11 are accurately reflected
   - Verify Task 35 planning documentation aligns with project roadmap
   - Check that the FHIR services directory structure documentation matches implementation

4. Documentation Build Test:
   - If using a documentation generator (like Sphinx or MkDocs):
     - Run the documentation build process
     - Verify no build errors occur
     - Check that all new content appears correctly in the generated documentation

5. Peer Review Process:
   - Have at least two team members review the documentation changes
   - One reviewer should focus on technical accuracy
   - One reviewer should focus on clarity and completeness
   - Address all feedback before finalizing

6. Documentation Accessibility Test:
   - Verify all documentation is accessible through the project's standard documentation channels
   - Test all internal links between documentation files
   - Ensure any diagrams or images have appropriate alt text
