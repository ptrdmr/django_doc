# Task ID: 26
# Title: Verify PHI Data Encryption Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 21, 20, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive verification procedures to ensure all Protected Health Information (PHI) is properly encrypted at rest in the Django HIPAA-compliant application, including database-level checks, test data creation, decryption testing, and automated test suite development.
# Details:
Implement a thorough verification process for PHI data encryption:

1. Database-level verification:
   - Use Django's ORM to query encrypted fields in Patient and Document models
   - Compare raw database values with decrypted values to ensure encryption
   ```python
   from django.db import connection
   from patients.models import Patient
   
   def verify_patient_encryption():
       patient = Patient.objects.first()
       with connection.cursor() as cursor:
           cursor.execute("SELECT encrypted_field FROM patients_patient WHERE id = %s", [patient.id])
           raw_value = cursor.fetchone()[0]
       decrypted_value = patient.encrypted_field
       assert raw_value != decrypted_value, "Encryption not applied"
   ```

2. Create test patients with sample PHI:
   - Develop a factory or fixture to generate test patients with realistic PHI
   ```python
   from faker import Faker
   from patients.models import Patient
   
   fake = Faker()
   
   def create_test_patient():
       return Patient.objects.create(
           mrn=fake.unique.random_number(digits=8),
           first_name=fake.first_name(),
           last_name=fake.last_name(),
           dob=fake.date_of_birth(),
           ssn=fake.ssn(),
           address=fake.address(),
           phone=fake.phone_number()
       )
   ```

3. Test decryption functionality:
   - Verify that encrypted data can be correctly retrieved and decrypted
   ```python
   def test_patient_decryption():
       patient = create_test_patient()
       retrieved_patient = Patient.objects.get(id=patient.id)
       assert retrieved_patient.ssn == patient.ssn, "Decryption failed"
   ```

4. Verify searchable metadata extraction:
   - Ensure that searchable fields do not contain PHI
   - Test search functionality using non-PHI metadata
   ```python
   def test_searchable_metadata():
       patient = create_test_patient()
       search_result = Patient.objects.filter(mrn=patient.mrn).first()
       assert search_result, "Search failed"
       assert not hasattr(search_result, 'ssn'), "PHI exposed in search"
   ```

5. Create automated tests:
   - Develop a comprehensive test suite using Django's testing framework
   - Include unit tests and integration tests for encryption/decryption
   ```python
   from django.test import TestCase
   from patients.models import Patient
   
   class PHIEncryptionTests(TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           self.patient = create_test_patient()
       
       def test_encryption_at_rest(self):
           # Implementation of database-level verification
           pass
       
       def test_decryption(self):
           # Implementation of decryption test
           pass
       
       def test_search_without_phi(self):
           # Implementation of searchable metadata test
           pass
   ```

6. Document encryption verification procedures:
   - Create a detailed markdown document outlining all verification steps
   - Include instructions for running automated tests and manual checks
   - Store this documentation in the project repository for easy access during audits
   ```markdown
   # PHI Encryption Verification Procedures
   
   This document outlines the steps to verify PHI encryption in our HIPAA-compliant application.
   
   ## Automated Tests
   1. Run the test suite: `python manage.py test patients.tests.PHIEncryptionTests`
   2. Verify all tests pass
   
   ## Manual Verification
   1. Database Inspection:
      - Use a database client to view raw data
      - Confirm encrypted fields contain ciphertext
   
   2. Decryption Check:
      - Log in to the application
      - View a patient record
      - Confirm PHI is readable in the UI but encrypted in the database
   
   ## Compliance Audit Preparation
   - Generate and save encryption test reports
   - Review and update this document quarterly
   ```

7. Implement continuous verification:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline that runs encryption tests on every build
   - Configure alerts for any encryption test failures
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/encryption_tests.yml
   name: PHI Encryption Tests
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v2
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v2
           with:
             python-version: '3.9'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             python -m pip install --upgrade pip
             pip install -r requirements.txt
         - name: Run encryption tests
           run: python manage.py test patients.tests.PHIEncryptionTests
   ```

8. Regular key rotation and re-encryption:
   - Implement a secure key rotation mechanism
   - Create a process for re-encrypting data with new keys
   ```python
   from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
   from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
   from patients.models import Patient
   
   class Command(BaseCommand):
       help = 'Rotate encryption keys and re-encrypt patient data'
   
       def handle(self, *args, **options):
           new_key = Fernet.generate_key()
           for patient in Patient.objects.all():
               # Re-encrypt each field with the new key
               patient.save()  # Trigger re-encryption on save
           # Update the key in a secure key management system
   ```

Ensure all these steps are implemented and regularly reviewed to maintain HIPAA compliance and data security.

# Test Strategy:
To verify the PHI Data Encryption Implementation:

1. Run the automated test suite:
   ```
   python manage.py test patients.tests.PHIEncryptionTests
   ```
   Ensure all tests pass, including encryption at rest, decryption, and searchable metadata tests.

2. Perform manual database inspection:
   - Use a database client to connect to the application's database
   - Query the patients table and verify that PHI fields (e.g., SSN, DOB) contain ciphertext, not plaintext

3. Test patient creation and retrieval:
   - Use the application's UI or API to create a new patient with sample PHI
   - Retrieve the patient's information and verify it's displayed correctly
   - Check the database to confirm the stored data is encrypted

4. Verify search functionality:
   - Perform searches using non-PHI criteria (e.g., MRN)
   - Confirm that search results do not expose PHI in logs or metadata

5. Test decryption process:
   - Retrieve a patient record programmatically
   - Verify that encrypted fields can be correctly decrypted and read

6. Audit log verification:
   - Perform various operations on patient data (create, read, update)
   - Check the audit logs to ensure all PHI access is properly logged without exposing the PHI itself

7. Key rotation test:
   - Run the key rotation command
   - Verify that all patient data is re-encrypted with the new key
   - Confirm that data can still be correctly decrypted after rotation

8. Continuous integration check:
   - Push a code change to the repository
   - Verify that the CI/CD pipeline runs the encryption tests automatically

9. Documentation review:
   - Examine the encryption verification procedures document
   - Ensure it's up-to-date and includes all necessary steps for a compliance audit

10. Penetration testing:
    - Attempt to access the database directly and confirm inability to read PHI
    - Try to intercept network traffic and verify that no PHI is transmitted in plaintext

11. Performance impact assessment:
    - Measure application performance before and after implementing encryption
    - Ensure that encryption doesn't significantly impact system responsiveness

12. Error handling:
    - Simulate encryption/decryption errors (e.g., by temporarily altering keys)
    - Verify that the application handles these errors gracefully without exposing PHI

13. Third-party security audit:
    - Engage a certified security firm to perform an independent audit of the encryption implementation
    - Address any findings or recommendations from the audit

Document all test results and keep records for compliance purposes. Regularly repeat these verification steps, especially after any system changes that might affect data handling or encryption.
