refactor(documents): remove obsolete pessimistic review workflow code (Task 41.27)

Cleaned up obsolete code from the old pessimistic locking review workflow and
updated templates/messaging to reflect the optimistic concurrency model where
documents merge automatically without requiring manual approval.

## Phase 1: Removed Obsolete Celery Task

### Deleted merge_to_patient_record Task
- Removed entire task from apps/documents/tasks.py (~234 lines)
- Task waited for manual approval before merging - completely redundant
- New system merges automatically in process_document_async (lines 921-953)
- Replaced with comment explaining removal

### Updated Management Command
- apps/documents/management/commands/migrate_fhir_data.py
- Removed obsolete task import
- Replaced task.delay() call with inline merge logic
- Now uses patient.add_fhir_resources() directly
- Updated display: "Approved: True/False" → "Review Status: <status>"
- Simplified migration detection (removed approval checks)

### Updated Admin View
- apps/documents/views.py - MigrateFHIRDataView
- Removed obsolete task import
- Removed auto-approval code (lines 2055-2060)
- Already had inline merge logic, just cleaned up

## Phase 2: Simplified DocumentReviewView

### Streamlined handle_approval() Method
- Removed ~50 lines of redundant FHIR merge logic (lines 1768-1798)
- Data already merged automatically during document processing
- Kept patient comparison resolution logic (Task 13 - still needed)
- Updated docstring: "approval and merge" → "mark review as complete"
- Updated success message to reflect data already in patient record

### Updated Review Template
- templates/documents/review.html
- Button text: "Complete Review & Approve" → "Complete Review"
- Added note: "Data already merged to patient record"
- Confirmation dialog: "will be permanently added" → "mark review as complete"
- Status badge: "Approved" → "Reviewed"
- Success message: "approved and committed" → "reviewed and is in"
- Comment: "approval workflow" → "review workflow"

## Phase 3: Deprecated is_approved Field

### Added Deprecation Warnings
- apps/documents/models.py
- Enhanced field comment with clear deprecation notice
- Explained review_status is now authoritative
- Updated approve_extraction() docstring
- Updated reject_extraction() docstring
- Field kept for backward compatibility (no schema change)

### Removed Obsolete Checks
- migrate_fhir_data.py: Removed approval check logic
- MigrateFHIRDataView: Removed auto-approval before merge
- Both now only check is_merged status

## Files Modified

- apps/documents/tasks.py (-234 lines)
  * Deleted merge_to_patient_record task
  
- apps/documents/views.py (-56 lines)
  * Simplified handle_approval() method
  * Removed obsolete imports
  * Removed auto-approval from MigrateFHIRDataView
  
- apps/documents/models.py (+8 lines)
  * Added deprecation comments for is_approved field
  * Updated method docstrings
  
- apps/documents/management/commands/migrate_fhir_data.py (-8 lines, +15 lines)
  * Replaced task call with inline merge
  * Updated display fields
  * Simplified logic
  
- templates/documents/review.html (~8 lines modified)
  * Updated button text and messaging
  * Changed confirmation dialog
  * Updated status badge
  * Changed "approval" → "review" terminology

## System Impact

**Before (Pessimistic):**
Upload → Extract → Hold → Manual Approve → merge_to_patient_record → Merge

**After (Optimistic):**
Upload → Extract → Auto-merge → Flag if needed → Review later

**User Experience:**
- Data appears immediately in patient records (no bottleneck)
- Only flagged documents need review
- Review interface clarifies data already merged
- Terminology: "approval" → "review/verification"

## Testing & Verification

- ✅ Django system check: No issues
- ✅ Verification actions tests: 18/18 passing
- ✅ Optimistic concurrency tests: All passing
- ✅ Full document app tests: 121/121 passing (1 skipped)
- ✅ 0 linter errors in all modified files

## What Was NOT Done (Intentional)

**Documentation updates postponed:**
- Task 41.28 (HIPAA audit logging) not yet complete
- Will update docs after 41.28 to reflect complete system

**Database schema unchanged:**
- is_approved field kept for backward compatibility
- Marked as deprecated in code
- Future migration task will remove column

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes maintain backward compatibility.

## Migration Required

None. No database schema changes.
