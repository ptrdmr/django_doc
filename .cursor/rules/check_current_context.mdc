# Date/Time Awareness Rule

## **ALWAYS Check Current Date/Time**

Before updating any documentation, **ALWAYS** read the `.current-context` file in the project root to get:

- ✅ **Current Date** - Know what day it is for accurate timestamps
- ✅ **Current Time** - Know when the context was last updated

## **Usage**

### **When Writing Documentation:**
```markdown
# ✅ DO: Use the CURRENT_DATE from .current-context for timestamps
*Updated: 2025-08-01 - Feature implementation*

# ❌ DON'T: Guess or use wrong dates
*Updated: January 2025* # Wrong if context shows August!
```

## **Context File Location**
- **File:** `.current-context` (project root)
- **Updates:** Every 5 minutes automatically
- **Use:** Get current date/time for accurate documentation timestamps

---

**Remember:** Like checking the calendar before writing the date - always look at the context file to know what day it is!
