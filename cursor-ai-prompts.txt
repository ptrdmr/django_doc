"How much of the Patient Management module is complete? What's left to do?"

"Can you show me which high-priority tasks are still pending?"

## 🎯 FOCUSED DEVELOPMENT

"I have 2 hours to code. What's the best task or subtask I can complete in that time?"

"I want to focus on [specific module/feature]. What tasks in that area are ready to work on?"

"I'm in the mood to work on [frontend/backend/security/etc]. What tasks match that type of work?"

## 🔧 TASK MANAGEMENT

"This module is complete. Can you help me prepare it for integration with other parts of the system?"

"I want to do a quick demo of what we've built so far. Can you help me set up a demo scenario?"

## 💡 TIPS FOR BETTER AI COLLABORATION

1. Be specific about what you want help with
2. Mention Task Master when you want progress tracked
3. Ask for explanations if you don't understand something
4. Let me know if you want to learn WHY something works a certain way
5. Tell me if you prefer a different coding style or approach
6. Ask me to break down complex problems into smaller steps
7. Request code comments and documentation as we build

## 🎯 EXAMPLE FULL WORKFLOW PROMPT

"I'm starting a new development session. Can you:
1. Check Task Master for my next task
2. Show me the task details and requirements  
3. Mark it as in-progress
4. Help me implement the first subtask
5. Update our progress as we go

I'm ready to code!"

## 🆘 WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

"I'm confused about [specific thing]. Can you explain it step-by-step?"
